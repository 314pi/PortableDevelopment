Ini Translator Overview
==========================================================================================================

Ini Translator is a small Windows tool to simplify the translation of ini style language files (as used by programs like FlashGet, Inno Setup, ISTool and Wallpaper Sequencer to name a few) and the GUI is similar to that of poEdit (a translation editor for gnu gettext).

Some of it's main features are:
- Uses Troy Wolbrinks TNT controls for correct display regardless of locale
- Uses Jordan Russell's Toolbar2000 (http://www.jrsoftware.org) for that slick look
- Uses Alex Denisov's TBX enhancements to Toolbar2000 (http://g32.org)
- Uses TBX Themes created by Roy Magne Klever and others (http://www.rmklever.com)
- Uses SpTBX for Unicode support in toolbars and menus (http://club.telepolis.com/silverpointdev/sptbxlib/index.htm)
- Uses Addictive Software's Addict spell checker (http://www.addictivesoftware.com)
- Dictionaries with support for auto-translation, inversion and multiple translations for each item
- Sorting of original/translation column
- Monitoring of external changes to open files 
- Quick jump to next/previous untranslated item
- Quickly find "conspicious" items (configurable)
- Command line interface with "script"-capability
- Search and Replace
- Comment viewer and editor
- Bookmark support
- Support for loading/saving using different encodings (ANSI, UTF-8, Unicode)
- Localizable using ini-style language files
- Plugin support for loading and saving to any conceivable file-format
- Many plugins included to read and write many popular and common file formats

Ini Translator is hosted at sourceforge and is released under the MPL 1.1 license.
