  This should make it possible to load just about any type of language file by defining
  the appropriate characters. There is no provision for changing these values yet,
  so at present this ability is more of academic interest...

- Fixed bug in Replace dialog where "Replace all" didn't replace the text in the currently selected item
- Added "Encode" to richedit popup-menus: select some text and hit Ctrl+E to see the text encoded in hex (currently in a dialog, but this will change). This is nice to have when working with language files that contain non-printing characters (like pagepromoter)
- Added charmap.exe to menu (if it is installed). Makes it a bit easier to insert foreign and non-printing characters if needed

2003-04-21
- Accepts dropped files according to the following rules:
  * Drop one file: drop in left part of window to load as original file, drop in right part to load as translation
  * Drop two files: first file is original, second tranlsation
  * Drop three files (or more): first file is original, second file is translation, third file is dictionary
- Comments are now saved with the item it precedes
- New option: "Use same start folder for all files". When enabled, the translation file start folder is recalculated when the original file start folder is changed (and vice versa).
- Added new images to the listview. Can display four different icons now: no comments-untranslated/no comments-translated/comments-untranslated/comments-translated

- Now loads translation files directly instead of using TMemIniFile. This should mean faster load times and the ability to use language files without sections. Comments should also be preserved.
- Added options dialog and new options. Removed unnecessary menu items as a result of this
- Rewrote "Translate" logic to be able to save/load translations for the options dialog (and any other future forms)
- Options moved to TAppOpttions class
- Split code into several new logical units (consts, utils, options, language)
- Added URL:s to 3rd party tools in description.txt
- Fixed bug in statusbar text (inverted dictionary was showing number of items isto dictionary filename)
- Tweaked file monitor code to get rid of spurious (and wrong!) "file was modified outside program" warnings
