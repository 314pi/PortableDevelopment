      The ini file format
    </h3>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      The file format natively supported by this program follows the original ini file format used
      in Windows. An ini file is a text file with rows of items where each group of items are
      delimited by a <em>Section</em>. Each Section can contain any number of
      <em>Name=</em><em>Value</em> pairs. Each section must be unique within the file. A section is
      enclosed in square brackets (i.e. [Section]) and the left square bracket must be the first
      character on the line. The Section can contain spaces. All characters following the right
      square bracket are ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      A Name=Value pair must appears on a single line and the start of the Name must be the first
      character on the row. A Name can contain any character except the equal sign as it is used as
      the delimiter before the Value. A Value can contain any characters, including equal
      signs. Within a Section, a Name must be unique, but a Value doesn't have to be. Sections,
      Names and Values are handled in a case-insensitive manner. Values may not contain line-break
      characters. A line starting with a semi-colon is handled as a comment and ignored.

      <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre>
;This is a comment
[Section]
Name1=Value1
Name2=Value2
</pre>
    <p class="InfoField">
      <strong>NOTE:</strong> starting with 1.3, IniTranslator can also handle
      files without any Sections - all items will then be part of an empty Section and a section
      will <em>not</em> be written to the file when saving. In addition, version 1.3 and later
      also preserves comments at their original location.
