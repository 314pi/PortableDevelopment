      The program has some simplifications to avoid the use of the mouse as much as possible. While
      you are typing in the Translation field, you can move around in the list simply by pressing
      <strong>Ctrl+Up</strong> (Arrow), <strong>Ctrl+Down</strong> (Arrow),
      <strong>Ctrl+PageUp</strong>, <strong>Ctrl+PageDown</strong>,
      <strong>Ctrl+Home</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Ctrl+End</strong>&nbsp;on the keyboard. The
      program will move to another item without leaving the translation field. The currently edited
      item will be saved automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      All commands (except the list column sorting) are available from the menu and most menu items
      have associated shortcut keys.&nbsp;To activate the menu with the keyboard, press F10 and
      then use the arrow keys to move around. Press <strong>ENTER</strong> on the menu item you
      want to execute. To return focus to the program, press <strong>ESCAPE</strong> one
      or&nbsp;more times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select <strong>Next untranslated</strong> (Ctrl+U) and <strong>Previous untranslated</strong>
      (Ctrl+Shift+U) from the menu to quickly jump to the next or previous empty translation. You
      can sort the items in the list by clicking on one of the columns. This way the empty items
      are placed at the top or bottom of the list (depending on sort direction) and you can quickly
      estimate the number of items to translate and also quickly translate items since you don't
      have to look for them.
