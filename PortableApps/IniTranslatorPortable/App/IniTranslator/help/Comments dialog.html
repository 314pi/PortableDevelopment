      The comments dialog displays any available comments at the currently selected line.
      Logically, comments are grouped with the Name/Value following it. Comments are shown both for
      the original file and the translation file:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      <img alt="The comments dialog" src="images/Comments.jpg" />
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      You can "attach" the comment window to the main window by clicking the thumb-tack button.
      When attached, the comment window follows the main window when it is moved.
    </p>

      Starting with version 1.7, translation comments can be also be edited.
