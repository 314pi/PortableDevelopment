    <h4>
      Overview
    </h4>
    <p>
      There are two kinds of plugins supported by IniTranslator: file parsers and tool items. A
      file parser reads and writes files in formats not natively supported by IniTranslator. This
      allows you to work with any type of file that can represent its text content as
      original/translation string pairs without having to leave IniTransaltor. There are several
      file parsers supplied in the default installation of IniTranslator.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tool plugin works with the items already loaded into IniTranslator. These plugins appear on
      a special Plugins menu whenever they are available. These types of plugins are used to
      perform common tasks, like trimming text or supplying an alternative method of editing the
      items.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>
      Writing plugins
    </h4>
    <p>
      Developers can write their own plugins if they have access to a development tool that
      fulfills these requirements :
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>it must understand interfaces
      </li>
      <li>it must be able to create pure 32-bit Windows DLL files
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The following discussion assumes Delphi syntax, but you can use any tool that supports the
      requirements above.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="InfoField">
      <strong>Note</strong><br />
      <br />
      When a function or method returns a <strong>HResult</strong>, you should generally return
      <strong>S_OK</strong> if the method executed normally, <strong>S_FALSE</strong> otherwise. If
      any other return value is expected, it is described in the documentation.<br />
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>
      Writing a file parser
    </h4>
    <p>
      A file parser imports and exports file data to/from IniTranslator. It doesn't matter to
      IniTranslator in what format the data is stored as long as it can be translated to the
      concept of a Original-Translation pair. A file parser must implement the IFileParser
      interface:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <pre>
<strong>type</strong>
  IFileParser = <strong>interface</strong>(IInterface)
  ['{3E556846-9B4D-4722-B48F-48D020715509}']
<em>    </em><strong>function</strong> ExportItems(<strong>const</strong> Items, Orphans: ITranslationItems): HResult; <strong>safecall</strong>;
    <strong>function</strong> ImportItems(<strong>const</strong> Items, Orphans: ITranslationItems): HResult; <strong>safecall</strong>;
    <strong>function</strong> DisplayName(Capability: integer): WideString; <strong>safecall</strong>;
    <strong>function</strong> Capabilities: integer; <strong>safecall</strong>;
    <strong>function</strong> Configure(Capability: integer): HResult; <strong>safecall</strong>;
    <strong>procedure</strong> Init(<strong>const</strong> ApplicationServices: IApplicationServices); <strong>safecall</strong>;
  <strong>end</strong>;
</pre>
    <p>
      <strong>ExportItems</strong> is called whenever the user has chosen to export the items in
      IniTranslator using this file parser. You should provide a preview dialog where the user can
      see the effect of his changes, provide additional options if necessary and save the file if
      the user so chooses. A generic Delphi export form is provided in the source sohould you need
      one or you could build your own.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>ImportItems</strong> is called whenever the user chooses to import a file using this
      parser. You should provide a dialog where the user can select the file(s) to import and
      provide any additional options required to succesfully improt a file.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>DisplayName</strong> is called whenever IniTranslator needs to display info about the
      plugin in the UI. Capability is either CAP_IMPORT or CAP_EXPORT indicating which string is
      required.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Capabilities</strong> is called by Initransaltor to determine if the file parser
      supports importing, exporting or bith. Additionally, if your plugin provide some type of
      configuration dialog you can return this capability as well. The return value of Capabilities
      is a combination of the values CAP_IMPORT, CAP_EXPORT and CAP_CONFIGURE
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Configure</strong> is called either when the user clicks the Configure button in the
      UI or when he elects to import/export using this parser. Capability indicates whether this
      request originated in the import (CAP_IMPORT) or export (CAP_EXPORT) dialog.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Init</strong> is called before any other methods of the plugin. You should store an
      internal reference to the IApplicationServices interface if you plan to use any of its
      services later on (like calling the Translate method). If you are planning on displaying
      dialogs of your own (most file parses do), you should at least store the DLL's current
      ApplicationHandle, change it to use IApplicationServices.AppHandle and, when the DLL is
      unloaded, restore the original ApplicationHandle. This ensures that any dialogs that your
      plugin displays, will behave correctly with IniTranslator.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>
      Writing a tool plugin
    </h4>
    <p>
      A tool plugin works on the items loaded into IniTranslator. Typical usage is performing a
      specific action on one or more items in the list, providing an alternative editing experience
      or viewing the data in another format. The IToolItem interface definition look like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
<strong>type</strong>
  IToolItem = <strong>interface</strong>(IInterface)
  ['{E14F5620-0EC9-43B5-816C-1A265C3FF237}']
    <strong>function </strong>DisplayName: WideString; <strong>safecall</strong>;
    <strong>function </strong>About: WideString; <strong>safecall</strong>;
    <strong>function </strong>Status(<strong>const </strong>Items, Orphans: ITranslationItems; <strong>const </strong>SelectedItem: ITranslationItem): Integer; <strong>safecall</strong>;
    <strong>function </strong>Icon: LongWord; <strong>safecall</strong>;
    <strong>function </strong>Execute(<strong>const </strong>Items, Orphans: ITranslationItems; <strong>var </strong>SelectedItem: ITranslationItem): HResult; <strong>safecall</strong>;
    <strong>procedure </strong>Init(<strong>const </strong>ApplicationServices: IApplicationServices); <strong>safecall</strong>;
  <strong>end</strong>;
</pre>
    <p>
      <strong>DisplayName</strong> should return the text to show in the UI (on a menu item or
      similar)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>About</strong> should return a string that in more detail describes the plugin,
      information about the creator etc (currently not used)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Status</strong> should return the current status of the plugin. Use the passed in
      parameters to help you determine whether to enable or disable the plugin. The valid values
      you can return is a bit-wise combination of the constants <strong>TOOL_VISIBLE, TOOL_ENABLED,
      TOOL_CHECKED</strong>. You should treat the parameters as read-only in this method, i.e donät
      try to add, edit or delete items in the lists.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Icon</strong> should return a handle to an icon (not currently used). Return 0 if
      there is no icon
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Execute</strong> is called when the user activates the plugin (currently by clicking
      the menu item). This is where the plugin does its work. You can add, delete and modify the
      items in the Items and Orphans list and you can change the value of the SelectedItem if you
      like. The UI is frozen until you return from this method.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Init</strong> is called before any other methods of the plugin. You should store an
      internal reference to the IApplicationServices interface if you plan to use any of its
      services later on (like calling the Translate method). If you are planning on displaying
      dialogs of your own (most file parses do), you should at least store the DLL's current
      ApplicationHandle, change it to use IApplicationServices.AppHandle and, when the DLL is
      unloaded, restore the original ApplicationHandle. This ensures that any dialogs that your
      plugin displays, will behave correctly with IniTranslator.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Registering a plugin
    </h4>
    <p>
      Every plugin must export one or more functions from the DLL that tells IniTranslator that a
      plugin available from the DLL. Due to the internal structure of IniTranslator, a DLL can only
      contain one single file parser, but you can have as meny tool plugins as you like.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      To register a file parser, export a function named <em>"RegisterTransFileParser001"</em> with
      the following signature:
    </p>
    <pre>
<strong>function </strong>(<strong>out </strong>Parser: IFileParser): HResult; <strong>stdcall</strong>;
</pre>
    <pre>
When this function is called, you should create an instance of a class that implements IFileParser and return it in the Parser variable.
</pre>
    <p>
      To register your tool plugins, export a function named <em>"RegisterTransToolItems001"</em>
      with the following signature:
    </p>
    <pre>
<strong>function </strong>(<strong>out </strong>ToolItems: IToolItems): HResult; <strong>stdcall</strong>;
</pre>
    <p>
      Note that this function actually returns an interface that can hold a list of IToolItem and
      thus you can register more than one tool plugin per DLL. When this function is called, you
      should create an instance of a class that implements IToolItems and return it in the
      ToolItems variable.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h4>
      Supporting localization
    </h4>
    <p>
      Not only is IniTranslator a translation tool, but it also supports having its own UI
      translated. IniTranslator uses text files in ini file format with the extension .lng for its
      own language files. These files can be edited with IniTranslator itself. You can use the
      IniTranslator translation mechanism in your plugins by performing two simple steps:
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Implement the ILocalizable interface in each of your file parsers and/or tool plugins
      </li>
      <li>Call IApplicationServices.Translate whenever you need to display a text in your plugins
      UI
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The ILocalizable interface looks like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
<strong>type</strong>
  ILocalizable = <strong>interface</strong>(IInterface)
  ['{E10D0143-B334-4CCE-898A-F25384D79C6E}']
    <strong>function </strong>GetString(<strong>out </strong>Section:WideString; <strong>out </strong>Name:WideString; <strong>out </strong>Value:WideString):WordBool;<strong> stdcall</strong>;
  <strong>end</strong>;
</pre>
    <p>
      This is a very simple interface with only one method and the only thing you need to do is to
      supply a new Name/Value pair every time the method is called. You should also supply at least
      one Section name that is unique to you, your company or your plugin (you can use several
      Section names if you like). Return true as long as Section, Name and Value contains valid
      values. Do not include carriage returns or line feeds in the strings. Instead, encode these
      as "\r\n" or use another scheme you prefer.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      This method is only called when the user creates a new translation template for
      IniTranslator. This is not something users do regularily. In fact, most users never do it,
      opting to use default.lng or another language file in the languages folder of their
      installation.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      To access the translated strings at runtime (they might not be translated; this depends on
      whether the user has a UI language file loaded or not), use the
      <strong>IApplicationServices.Translate(Section, Name, Value)</strong> method, passing in the
      same Section and Name as you returned from <strong>ILocalizable.GetString</strong>. As for
      Value, use the default value for the string. If the user has a .lng file loaded and a
      translation for your string was found, the translation is returned. If no string was found,
      the default Value is returned instead.<br />
