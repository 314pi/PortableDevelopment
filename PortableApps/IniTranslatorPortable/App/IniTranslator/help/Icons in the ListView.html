      The list view displays icons to the left of each item. You can use these icons to quickly
      determine the status of an item. The list view can display any of the following four icons:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      <img alt="" src="images/icon_comment.jpg" />&nbsp;- the item is translated and there is
      either a comment in the original or the translated file or both
    </p>
    <p>
      <img alt="" src="images/icon_comment_new.jpg" />&nbsp;- the item is not translated and there
      is either a comment in the original or the translated file or both
    </p>
    <p>
      <img alt="" src="images/icon_nocomment.jpg" />&nbsp;- the item is translated and there are no
      comments
    </p>
    <p>
      <img alt="" src="images/icon_nocomment_new.jpg" />&nbsp;- the item is not translated and
      there are no comments
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p class="InfoField">
      To view available comments, press <strong>Ctrl+M</strong> when the item is selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, a small marker is shown to the left of the icon if the item has been modified.
      Note that this marker is not visible if you set a bookmark on the item since the bookmark and
      the marker share the same space.
