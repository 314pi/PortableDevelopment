      dialog.&nbsp;

      The available options on this tab are:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        Show Quotes
      </dt>
      <dd>
        The Show Quotes options can be used to easier see where strings starts and ends. This is
        particularily important when the string contains leading and trailing white-space. Since
        the program normally trims off trailing (but not leading) spaces, the Show Quotes option is
        the only way to preserve trailing spaces. The quotes are for display purpose only: they are
        not saved with the string. If you inadverently delete one or both of the quotes this is
        alright too: the program detects that the quote(s) are missing and adjusts
        accordingly.<br />

      <dd>

        Displays the shortcut of the toolbar button in the tooltip. This option can only be changed
        if <strong>Show tooltips</strong> is enabled.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        Remember form position
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Enable this option if you want the program to remember the main windows position when you
        close it.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        Remember min/max state
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Enable this option if you want the program to remember if the window was
        minimized/maximized as well. This option can only be changed if <strong>Remember form
        position</strong> is enabled.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        Press RETURN to confirm translation
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Normally, a translation is saved as soon as you move to another item. Enable this option to
        use the RETURN (ENTER) key to confirm the translation without having to move to another
        item.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        Automatically move to next/previous
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Enable this option to automatically move to the next item when RETURN is pressed. Press
        Shift+RETURN to move to the previous item instead. This option can only be changed if
        <strong>Press RETURN to confirm translation</strong> is enabled.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        Use translation everywhere
      </dt>
      <dd>
        When activated, a newly typed translation will be copied to all other items with an
        identical original identifier. This is like using the "Use translation everywhere" command
        without having to press Ctr+Shift+H all the time.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        Autofocus translation when typing
      </dt>
      <dd>
        When activated, typing in the list will move focus to the translation field where your
        typing replaces the selected text.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        Font
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Changes the font used by the edit fields and the listview in the program. Use the drop down
        lists to select a font and a size. Click in the preview to edit the preview text. Click
        again to return to preview mode. Change the preview text to an empty string to restore the
        default display (font name and size).<br />

        Restart the program to use the selected language file.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        Help
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Select the file to be used as the help file for the program. Click the browse button (...)
        to show a dialog that allows you to select a file. Press <strong>F1</strong> in the program
        to display the help file. Note that you can select any type of file as the help file, not
        only chm or hlp files. When you press F1, the file will be opened with the program
        associated with the selected file type.

      </dt>

    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      The available options on the Advanced tab are:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        Use same start folder for all files
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Enable this option if you want the open translation dialog to "chase" the original dialog
        (and vice versa). This can be hard too understand, but an example might clear it up:
      </dd>
      <dd>
        <p class="InfoField">
          <br />
          Let's say you have a couple of files opened in your <code>C:\Program
          Files\Translations</code> folder. Now you want to open another set of files in the
          <code>D:\Other\Translations</code> folder instead. Click <strong>Open Original
          (Ctrl+O)</strong> and browse to the <code>D:\Other\Translations</code> and select a file
          as usual.<br />
          <br />
          Next, a dialog is shown for the translation file. With the "same folder" option enabled,
          the start folder for the dialog will be <code>D:\Other\Translations</code>. With the
          option disabled, the start folder will be <code>C:\Program
          Files\Translations</code>.<br />
        </p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        Show full filename in list columns
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Check this option if you want the list columns to display the path as well as the filename.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        Monitor external file changes
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Turns file monitoring on or off. If enabled, external changes to the currently loaded files
        (original, translation and dictionary) are monitored and you are prompted to reload the
        file(s) when they have changed.
      </dd>
      <dt>
        Encoding for new files
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Select the encoding to use when creating a new translation file. You can choose between
        ANSI, UTF-8 and Unicode.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        Ignore translated items when using dictionary
      </dt>
      <dd>
        When active, already translated items are skipped when using the dictionary. This option
        can also be changed from the dialog used when using the dictionary.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        Invert dictionary
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Same as the Invert diitionary on the main menu. Enabling this option swaps the currently
        loaded items in the dictionary so you can use the dictionary to translate "the other way"
        as well. Note that the inversion stays in effect if you save the dictionary and also when
        you load another dictionary (i.e if Invert Dictionary is enabled, the newly loaded
        dictionary will be inverted as well). You can also enable/disable this option from the main
        menu (<strong>Ctrl+Alt+I</strong>) without opening the dialog.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        Ignore &amp;'s in dictionaries
      </dt>
      <dd>
        If checked, '&amp;' characters are ignored when comparing dictionary entries to the
        original string. This enables you to have a dictionary entry like '&amp;Edit' and use it to
        replace a translation entry like 'Edit'.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        Header
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Specifies the text to add at the top of a file when saving it. To include the header, you
        have to select the "Save Translation As..." or "Save Original As..." option in the menu,
        check the "Header" checkbox an click OK. When you save normally, no header is added. The
        program does not validate the format of the header nor does it check if a header is already
        present in the file.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        Footer
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Specifies the text to add at the end of a file when saving it. To include the footer, you
        have to select the "Save Translation As..." or "Save Original As..."&nbsp; option in the
        menu, check the "Footer" checkbox an click OK. When you save normally, no footer is added.
        The program does not validate the format of the footer nor does it check if a footer is
        already present in the file.
