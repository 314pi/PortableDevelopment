      Command-file syntax
    </h3>
    <p>
      A command-file is an ordinary text file containing commands that you want the program to
      execute.&nbsp;Each command must appear on it's own line in the file. Empty and unrecognized
      lines are silently skipped (this is a good way to add comments).&nbsp;Commands must appear as
      the first item (i.e no whitespace or other characters) on the line. Parameters to the command
      are separated by one or more whitespace characters between the command and
      parameter.&nbsp;Commands are executed sequentially from top to bottom. Commands are not
      case-sensitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following commands are recognized by the program:

        If you don't specify any files to open (by using OPENORIG, OPENTRANS or OPENDICT), the
        program will load the files from the last time you ran it.

      Below is an example of a command-file that loads some files and a dictionary and then uses
      the dictionary to translate the file, saves the translation using a new name and then
      quits.&nbsp;Note that it uses relative, absolute and UNC paths.
