      Starting with version 1.7, IniTranslator now has a generic Import/Export interface. You can
      access the installed handlers from the <strong>File-Import</strong> and
      <strong>File-Export</strong> menu items.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The dialogs shows a list of all available file parsers. If a file parser supports both
      importing and exporting, it will appear in both dialogs. If the parser can be configured, the
      Configure button will be enabled and you can click it to adjust the parser settings.
      Double-click an item in the list to start the import/export. Depending on the parser
      implementation, you are presented with different alternatives, like a dialog to select the
      file(s) to import or a dialog to preview the file content before you export it.

      Ini Translator automatically loads any compatible DLL files it finds in the \plugins
      subfolder and adds it to the dialogs.

      <strong>Note:</strong>
      <p>
        When you do an import, IniTranslator clears the stored filenames to prevent accidentally
        saving the imported file(s) to the wrong destination. To save an import back to it's native
        format, you must export it. To revert to the previously loaded files, use <strong>Recent
        Files</strong> to locate the files and load them.
