      Use bookmarks to set a marker on&nbsp;a line in the listview and quickly jump to that
      line&nbsp;from anywhere in the file by pressing a shortcut key. When a bookmark is set, a
      small numbered icon is displayed to the left of the bookmarked line. This image shows some
      lines bookmarked:
