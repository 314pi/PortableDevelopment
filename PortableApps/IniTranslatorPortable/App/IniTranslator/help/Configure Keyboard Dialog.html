      The Configure Keyboard Dialog is used to change the shortcut key assignments for the commands
      in Ini Translator. Select <strong>Configure Keyboard</strong> from the menu to display the
      dialog.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Click on <strong>Categories</strong> to view the items that are part of a specific category.
      When a category is selected, the <strong>Commands</strong> list displays all commands in that
      group.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Select a command to display its shortcuts in the <strong>Current shortcuts</strong> list.
      Note that a command can have more than one shortcut.

      To remove a shortcut, select it in the list and click the <strong>Remove</strong> button.
    </p>
    <p>
      To add a new shortcut, focus the <strong>New shortcut</strong> edit field and press the keys
      you wish to use for the shortcut, including any Shift, Ctrl and Alt modifiers. If another
      command is already using the shortcut you selected, it's name is displayed underneath the
      shortcut list. If you wish to assign the shortcut you typed to the currently selected
      command, click the <strong>Add</strong> button.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Click the <strong>Reset</strong> button to restore the previous assignments. The Reset button
      is only enabled if you have made any changes to the shortcut assignments.

    <p class="InfoField">
      Note that the shortcut assignments are only restored to the way they were when you opened the
      dialog, i.e. any previous changes will not be&nbsp;restored or removed. To restore all
      shortcuts to their initial defaults, close the program, erase the translator.alf file and
      start the program again.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      The shortcut assignments are saved in the <strong>translator.alf</strong> file when you close
      the dialog and are available immediately in the program.
