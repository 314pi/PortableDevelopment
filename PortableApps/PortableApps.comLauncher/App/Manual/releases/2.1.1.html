<p>This release is the first bug-fix release for the 2.1 line and incidentally the
first bug-fix release for the PortableApps.com Launcher as a whole.</p>
<p>Three of these bugs are related to the already-starting detection which was
added in version 2.1. There were a few cases where the technique used was not
dealt with properly. In version 2.2, it is planned that the mechanism used to
flag it as &#8220;starting&#8221; will be changed from INI storage to mutexes, which will
be a lot more reliable and will not be able to get into the stuck state which
is common with a couple of these bugs.</p>
<p>For more information about the 2.1 release, see <a class="reference internal" href="2.1.html#releases-2-1"><em>PortableApps.com Launcher 2.1 release notes</em></a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="development-team">
<h2>Development team<a class="headerlink" href="#development-team" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First of all, we have a new team member in the PortableApps.com Launcher
development team: <strong>Aluísio Augusto Silva Gonçalves</strong> (known generally as
<strong>kAlug</strong>). He started contributing shortly after the release of 2.1 and has
done a number of the things on the 2.2 roadmap already, and has also identified
and fixed some of the bugs found in this release while I have been busy doing
mission work in India and so have had less time to spare on this than normal.
The release of 2.1.1 would have taken quite a lot longer without him (and the
delays have still been my fault, too). I thank kAlug for his contributions and
am looking forward to further work with him. <em>&#8212; Chris Morgan</em></p>

<h3>Tertiary launches don&#8217;t work<a class="headerlink" href="#tertiary-launches-don-t-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One of the new features in 2.1 is detection of an already-starting instance of
the portable app, which formerly could lead to data corruption. However, the
&#8220;starting&#8221; flag was set for secondary launches, and so tertiary launches would
fail to run while any instances were still running (depending slightly on the
app configuration).</p>
<p>Further details are available in the <a class="reference external" href="http://portableapps.com/node/28197">bug report</a>.</p>

<h3>Runtime data file left behind on host machine for secondary launches<a class="headerlink" href="#runtime-data-file-left-behind-on-host-machine-for-secondary-launches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>While investigating the bug mentioned above, another minor problem was found -
a file <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">runtimedata.ini</span></tt> was left behind in the plugin directory (which is a
subdirectory with a name like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nsXXXXXX</span></tt> in the user&#8217;s TEMP directory) for
all secondary instances. This has been fixed now.</p>

<div class="section" id="live-mode-breaks-after-the-first-run-on-writeable-medium">
<h3>Live mode breaks after the first run on writeable medium<a class="headerlink" href="#live-mode-breaks-after-the-first-run-on-writeable-medium" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In subsequent investigations <a class="reference external" href="http://portableapps.com/node/28522">a third bug was found</a>, related to the
&#8220;starting&#8221; detection, in Live mode. If the source directory was writeable, the
&#8220;starting&#8221; flag was set but never cleared, meaning that after the first run in
Live mode the app would not start again without deleting the runtime data file
manually. Now this does not break, though on a read-only medium the &#8220;starting&#8221;
check won&#8217;t function at all until 2.2.</p>

<h3>Flaws in automatic language switching in nested launchers<a class="headerlink" href="#flaws-in-automatic-language-switching-in-nested-launchers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Previously, if an app not running from the PortableApps.com Platform launched
another app, this other app would believe that the language had been set by the
Platform, thus ignoring its own saved language, if any. The typical case for
this is when an English-only app launches a multilingual app; formerly this
would have ended up with the multilingual app being reset to English.  To
resolve this, when the PortableApps.com Platform is missing, a special
environment variable is set to indicate the fact which will be picked up by
nested launchers, so that they have the option of using the last language used
(as defined by the <a class="reference internal" href="../ref/launcher.ini/language.html#std:ini-section-[LanguageFile]"><tt class="xref std std-ini-section docutils literal"><span class="pre">[LanguageFile]</span></tt></a> section in launcher.ini).</p>

<p>Previously, when the developer had set <a class="reference internal" href="../ref/launcher.ini/launch.html#std:ini-key-[Launch]:WaitForProgram"><tt class="xref std std-ini-key docutils literal"><span class="pre">[Launch]:WaitForProgram</span></tt></a> to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">false</span></tt>, and Live mode had been enabled, the launcher would just exit after
running the app, without cleaning up. Now, the value of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WaitForProgram</span></tt> is
simply ignored.</p>
