Getting help
============

If something isn't working for you, please first of all *read this manual*. In
particular, read the reference page for the feature you're using. If you can't
find the problem, try going through the section :ref:`troubleshooting`. There is
a list there which should resolve the most common problems and save you time and
help you learn more.

If you need help with the PortableApps.com Launcher, there are a few ways you
can get help:

* You can find people who might help in our `IRC chat room`_, #portableapps on
  irc.freenode.net. You are most likely to get help from Chris Morgan, the
  author and maintainer of the PortableApps.com Launcher. I'm regularly in IRC
  and use the nick *ChrisMorgan*. If I'm not there other people may also be able
  to help you or at least point you in the right direction.

* For a more complex question, or if no-one can help you in IRC, you can ask for
  help in the forums_.
