Installing the PortableApps.com Launcher
========================================

This document will get you up and running with the PortableApps.com Launcher.

To use the PortableApps.com Launcher, you will need to download and install the
`PortableApps.com Launcher`_ and `NSIS Portable`_ (the Unicode variant). These
two are enough for using the PortableApps.com Launcher Generator (see below) and
also for using the more advanced features like developing extra features with
:ref:`custom code <custom-code>` or :ref:`debugging <debug>`.

For NSIS Portable to be automatically detected, install it to a sibling
directory of the PortableApps.com Launcher, as ``NSISPortable``. If you are
using the PortableApps.com Platform, this will happen automatically; their
recommended installation paths are ``X:\PortableApps\PortableApps.comLauncher``
and ``X:\PortableApps\NSISPortable``.
