Bugs fixed
==========

:ini-section:`[DirectoriesMove]` not backing up some folders
------------------------------------------------------------

In certain situations with :ini-section:`[DirectoriesMove]`, a variable not
being reset would cause local data of the first entry in the
:ini-section:`[DirectoriesMove]` section to be deleted rather than backed up.

For those who like gory details, this bug only surfaces when both
:ini-section:`[FilesMove]` and :ini-section:`[DirectoriesMove]` are used, the
last entry in :ini-section:`[FilesMove]` is inside the package and the first
entry in :ini-section:`[DirectoriesMove]` is outside.

Here is a sample ``launcher.ini`` excerpt which would strike this bug:

.. code-block:: ini

   [FilesMove]
   settings.ini=%PAL:AppDir%\AppName

   [DirectoiresMove]
   appdata=%APPDATA%\AppName

This would cause any local data in the ``%APPDATA%\AppName`` directory to be
lost.

The severity of this bug is strongly mitigated by the fact that no officially
released apps are affected by this bug.

This bug was reported by prapper and fixed by kAlug. Further details are
available in the `bug report <http://portableapps.com/node/29043>`_.
