  apps.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] Conditions apply. Occasionally you may need something not supported out
         of the box. Then you may need :ref:`custom code <custom-code>`.

.. [#f2] Well, the rest of the launcher is yours to write. In particular,
         intelligent :ref:`language switching <languages>` is something
         you need to do yourself.
